# Description

Users are allowed to stake DAI to a Tea Party contract, this turns DAI into CHAI and generates interest to the contract. Only the beneficiary is able to retrieve the generated interests.

There is another contract in the project named memberships, and the goal is to set a role to the users that stake in order to give them diferent perks depending on their stake to the community.
